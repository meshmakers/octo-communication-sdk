# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Important**: Keep this file up to date when the codebase changes — new nodes, new services, or a

## Project Overview

**octo-communication-sdk** is the framework every OctoMesh adapter is built on: the ETL pipeline
engine, the node model, the trigger/execution contracts, and the adapter host. It has no adapter of
its own — it is consumed as NuGet packages by `octo-mesh-adapter`, `octo-adapter-loxone`,
`octo-plug-zenon` and the other adapter repos, so **a change here is a change to every adapter**.

It was carved out of `octo-sdk` in Phase 3 of the pipeline-YAML migration. The namespaces still read
`Meshmakers.Octo.Sdk.Common.*` on purpose — keeping them stable meant the nine consumer repos needed
no source changes beyond a package reference.

### Projects

| Project | Package | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `src/Sdk.Pipeline` | `Meshmakers.Octo.Sdk.Pipeline` | The ETL pipeline + node framework. `EtlDataPipeline/` holds the orchestrator, the path-only `IDataContext`, the node base types and the built-in nodes; `Services/` holds the execution contracts (`ExecutePipelineOptions`, `PipelineRegistration`, `VerifiedPrincipal`, the registry and polling services). |
| `src/Sdk.Adapters` | `Meshmakers.Octo.Sdk.Adapters` | The adapter host: `AdapterBuilder`, startup/shutdown, the controller hub callback, health and metrics. |
| `src/Sdk.CommunicationAdapter` | `Meshmakers.Octo.Sdk.CommunicationAdapter` | The `System.Sdk` CK model and the adapter contracts that go with it. |
| `src/Sdk.Common.Web` | `Meshmakers.Octo.Sdk.Common.Web` | ASP.NET Core hosting for sockets and plugs. |
| `src/Sdk.SimulationNodes` | `Meshmakers.Octo.Sdk.SimulationNodes` | Simulation pipeline nodes and their generators. |
| `src/Sdk.Plug.Simulation` | *(executable)* | The plug-simulation service; publishes its own Helm chart (AB#4948). |

`samples/` holds `Sdk.Plugs.Sample` and `Sdk.Socket.WebSample`; neither is packaged.

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Local development — 999.0.0, restores from ../nuget
dotnet build -c DebugL
dotnet test  -c DebugL --no-build

dotnet build -c Release
```

Three configurations: `Debug`, `Release`, `DebugL`. **DebugL** pins every version to `999.0.0` and
prepends `../nuget` to `RestoreSources`; every packable project has `GeneratePackageOnBuild`, so a
build drops the `.nupkg` into `<project>/bin/DebugL/`.

⚠️ **Propagating a change to the consumers is three steps, and skipping any of them looks like the
change did not happen:**

1. Build (`dotnet build -c DebugL`). An **incremental** build can skip the pack target and leave a
   **stale `.nupkg` next to a fresh DLL** — always verify the package actually carries the new
   assembly (`unzip -p <nupkg> lib/net10.0/<Assembly>.dll | shasum` against the built one) before
   trusting a downstream test result.
2. Copy every `Meshmakers.*.999.0.0.nupkg` from `*/bin/DebugL/` into `dev/nuget/` — that is the feed
   the consumer repos restore from under DebugL (`Copy-NuGetPackages` in octo-tools does this).
3. Delete `~/.nuget/packages/<package>/999.0.0`. The global cache is checked before the local feed,
   so without this the consumer keeps building against the previous package no matter what is in
   `dev/nuget` (`Remove-GlobalNuGetPackages` in octo-tools).

Test projects: `Sdk.Common.Tests` (unit), `Sdk.Common.IntegrationTests`, and
`Sdk.Common.PipelineParityTests` — the last one enforces the Newtonsoft→System.Text.Json numeric and
scalar round-trip contract with Newtonsoft as the oracle. See `octo-construction-kit-engine/CLAUDE.md`
for the serialization rules themselves.

## Pipeline data flow

The pipeline data path is **System.Text.Json only** and goes through the path-only `IDataContext`
(`EtlDataPipeline/IDataContext.cs`). Nodes never see `JToken`/`JObject`/`JArray`, and node code must
not pass `JsonSerializerOptions` into any `IDataContext` method — the STJ details are internal to the
implementation. `SystemTextJsonOptions.Default` is the single options bundle; its
`UnsafeRelaxedJsonEscaping` encoder is load-bearing for every consumer that **hashes** serialized
output.

## Execution identity — what this repo owns

The adapter decides which identity a pipeline execution acts as (`PipelineIdentityResolver`, AB#5028,
in `octo-mesh-adapter`). What lives **here** is the carrier and the triggers that fill it:

- **`ExecutePipelineOptions.VerifiedPrincipal`** (AB#4975) — the caller a trigger authenticated. A
  slim, token-free value object, because the trigger projects it into the pipeline data root, which is
  echoed in HTTP responses, persistable by `SetPipelineExecutionResult@1` and shown in the Studio
  debug panel.
- **`ExecutePipelineOptions.CallerAccessToken`** (AB#5031) — the caller's **raw** bearer token, for
  nodes that must act as the caller against another service (the delegation / on-behalf-of grant needs
  it as `subject_token`). 🔴 It must never reach the data root, never `VerifiedPrincipal`, and never
  `IEtlContext.Properties` — that dictionary hangs on the `PipelineRegistration` and is shared across
  **all runs** of the pipeline, so a token left there would outlive its request. It is a
  **per-execution** side channel: trigger → ETL context of exactly this execution, nowhere else.
- Both surface on `IEtlContext` as **default interface members**, so an adapter implementing the
  interface itself was not broken by their addition.

### The identity ends at a pipeline chain — by decision, and visibly (AB#5045)

`ToPipelineDataEvent@1` → `FromPipelineDataEvent@1` crosses the message bus. The trigger on the far
side builds its `ExecutePipelineOptions` **without** a `VerifiedPrincipal` and **without** a caller
token, so an HTTP-triggered pipeline that chains to a second one runs the first half as the user and
the second half as the service identity.

🔴 **That is the decision, not an oversight.** Forwarding the identity would let a pipeline act as a
caller the *target* never authenticated: the sender picks the routing key, so whoever may enqueue into
the data flow would inherit whoever last triggered the sending pipeline — and on the fire-and-forget
path the message has no bounded lifetime, so the identity would stay usable for as long as it sits in
the queue. A privilege escalation is not something to introduce as a side effect of a chaining node.
If a chained execution should ever run as the user, the identity has to be **established** on the far
side (verified), never relayed.

What the decision costs is that one logical request runs under two identities, so the transition is
made **visible** rather than silent: `ToPipelineDataEventNode.RecordIdentityBoundary` writes the
hand-off to the execution log (`INodeContext.Info` — the channel the adapter and the Studio debug
panel already surface, deliberately not a new one), naming the subject whose identity ends there and
the target pipeline that will resolve its own. Deliberately **not** on the message: its payload is
pipeline data and no credential may travel on it. Without a caller identity the same site logs at
debug level — the overwhelming majority of chains are service-to-service and an info line per hop
would drown the case that matters.

The same holds for **`FromExecutePipelineCommand@1`** (Studio "Execute" and the ExecutePipeline API).
That is the row most likely to be "improved" later, because the person clicking the button *is*
authenticated — but the command travels over the bus and this node authenticates nobody, so a
forwarded identity would be an assertion the target cannot check.

`FromPipelineDataEventNodeTests` and `FromExecutePipelineCommandNodeTests` pin that both start their
execution with neither value, and `ToPipelineDataEventNodeTests` pins that the hand-off is recorded
and that neither the token nor the subject reaches the message. See the AB#5029 matrix in
`octo-mesh-adapter/CLAUDE.md` for how this row fits the other trigger kinds.

## Adapter hub authentication (AB#5072)

The adapter acquires its **own** client-credentials access token at startup and presents it on the
`/{tenantId}/adapterHub` SignalR connection. Four pieces, in the order the token travels:

1. **`AdapterOptions.IssuerUri` / `ClientId` / `ClientSecret`** (section `Adapter`, i.e. env
   `OCTO_ADAPTER__ISSUERURI`, `__CLIENTID`, `__CLIENTSECRET`). `IsEnabled` is `IssuerUri && ClientId`
   — the secret is deliberately not part of the check, so a confidential client with a missing secret
   fails loudly at the token endpoint instead of silently degrading to an anonymous connection that
   looks healthy until the gate is armed. The tenant is the already-present `AdapterOptions.TenantId`.
2. **`ConfigureAdapterAuthenticatorOptions`** (`IConfigureOptions<AuthenticatorOptions>`) projects
   those four onto the SDK's `AuthenticatorOptions`, which `AuthenticatorClient` reads.
3. **`AdapterAccessTokenService`** (`BackgroundService`) requests the token
   (`ApiScopes.OctoApiFullAccess`, `DefaultScopes.None` → exactly `octo_api`, no `offline_access`)
   and writes it into the singleton `IServiceClientAccessToken`.
4. **`AdapterHubClient`** was already handed that same instance. The SDK reads it through
   `HttpConnectionOptions.AccessTokenProvider` on every connection attempt, so a refresh reaches the
   next (re)connect with no notification path.

**What was broken.** Nothing filled that holder at startup. The only production writer was
`ServiceAccountTokenService.EnsureTokenAsync` in `octo-mesh-adapter`, and all of its callers sit on
pipeline **execution** paths (`DeployPipeline@1`, `AnthropicAiQuery@1`, `MeshContextCreatorService`,
`PipelineIdentityResolver`). At connect time the holder was empty, the provider returned `null`, the
connection went out with no `Authorization` header, and the hub saw an anonymous caller identified
only by the unprotected `adapter-rtId` / `adapter-ckTypeId` headers. Worse than plainly anonymous: an
adapter that had already run one of those pipelines *did* present a token on its **next** reconnect,
so the fleet was not in a deterministic state and the adapter-hub gate's (AB#5063) `LogOnly`
inventory was not worth reading.

🔴 **`acr_values=tenant:{TenantId}` is not optional.** Since AB#5077 a token request without it is
issued for the **system** tenant, and the controller then refuses the adapter on its own tenant route
with a 403. That is what `ConfigureAdapterAuthenticatorOptions` exists to pin.

🔴 **Unconfigured is a supported state and must stay one.** Every adapter in the estate runs without
these keys today. Without a client id the service logs one warning, never calls the authenticator,
and the access token stays null — which makes the SDK send no `Authorization` header and no
`access_token` query parameter at all, i.e. exactly today's connection. A hard requirement here would
take the whole adapter fleet down on upgrade.

**Renewal.** A live SignalR connection is authorized once, at connect. The *re*connect is the
exposure, and adapters reconnect routinely (controller rollout, node drain, network blip, the SDK's
own retry loop, a wake from scale-to-zero). Hence the loop: replace the token `RefreshSkew` (5 min)
before its own `exp`, retry every `RetryInterval` (30 s) after a failure, and **keep the previous
token on failure** — it is no less usable than none. The first acquisition runs inside `StartAsync`,
before `base.StartAsync`; hosted services start sequentially and this one is registered **before**
every other hosted service in both `AdapterBuilder` and `WebAdapterBuilder`, so the first hub
connection already carries a token rather than racing it.

⚠️ **`Adapter:IssuerUri` is a second key next to `octo-mesh-adapter`'s `Adapter:AuthorityUrl`.** Both
bind the same configuration section and name the same identity service, but `AuthorityUrl`
(`MeshAdapterConfiguration`, in the adapter repo) is the **inbound** issuer secured
`FromHttpRequest@2` routes accept. That type is unknown to this SDK and adapters without it (Loxone,
Modbus, Zenon, the simulation plug) still need an issuer, so the outbound credential carries its own
key. They normally hold the same value.

**Mostly not in this repo:** delivering the credentials into the adapter. The secret lives as a
`ServiceAccountConfiguration` in the tenant DB; the route runs through the `ValueOverride`s the
controller sends to the operator at deploy time and through the adapter chart. This repo's C# only
makes the adapter *able* to authenticate — but `src/charts/octo-plug-simulation` is itself one of
those adapter charts and carries the delivery half.

🔴 **Every SDK-based adapter chart has to render the three keys, or that adapter stays anonymous.**
The three env vars are read by `AdapterOptions`, which every adapter shares, so the controller
projects the credentials for *all* of them — but Helm silently ignores values a chart does not read.
Eight charts carry the block, deliberately byte-identical: `octo-mesh-adapter`,
`octo-loxone-adapter`, `octo-plug-simulation`, `octo-weclapp-adapter`, `octo-modbus-plug`,
`octo-modbus-socket`, `octo-finapi-adapter`, `octo-eda-adapter`. A new adapter chart must copy it,
and `authUri` needs no plumbing — the operator writes it into every workload's context values
(`WorkloadContextValuesBuilder`). The value paths the controller writes are
`serviceAccountClientId` and the secret-flagged `secrets.serviceAccountClientSecret`; they are
pinned on the controller side in `PoolService`.

Tests: `tests/Sdk.Common.Tests/Adapters/AdapterAccessTokenServiceTests.cs` (token published into the
shared holder, scope shape, unconfigured never calls the authenticator in either direction, valid
token not re-acquired, refresh-window replacement, failure keeps the previous token, tokenless
response not published, `StartAsync` acquires before returning in both shapes, and neither secret nor
token in the **rendered** log output) and `ConfigureAdapterAuthenticatorOptionsTests.cs`.

## Node inventory (`src/Sdk.Pipeline/EtlDataPipeline/Nodes/`)

- **Triggers**: `FromPipelineDataEvent@1`, `FromExecutePipelineCommand@1`, `FromPolling@1`
- **Control**: `ForEach`, `For`, `Group`, `If`, `Switch`, `ObjectIterator`, `SelectByPath`
- **Extracts**: `SetJson`, `SetPrimitiveValue`, `SetArrayOfPrimitiveValues`,
  `GetPipelineConfigByWellKnownName`
- **Transforms**: `Concat`, `FormatString`, `Map`, `Project`, `Flatten`, `Join`, `Distinct`, `Math`,
  `LinearScaler`, `Hash`, `Base64Encode`/`Decode`, `ConvertDataType`, `DateTime`, `TransformString`,
  `ExecuteCSharp`, `Logger`, `PrintDebug`, `SumAggregation`
- **Loads**: `ToPipelineDataEvent@1`, `ToWebhook@1`, `SetPipelineExecutionResult@1`
- **Buffering**: `Buffer`, `BufferRetrieval`

Domain nodes (entity CRUD, stream data, HTTP, files, PDF, mail, …) live in `octo-mesh-adapter`, not
here.

## Development Notes

- Target framework `net10.0` only; `netstandard2.0` was dropped platform-wide in Phase 3.
- Nullable reference types are on and **warnings are errors**.
- The pipeline definition deserializer is **YamlDotNet**: a key that is *present and null* overwrites a
  C# property initializer, so node-configuration numbers and enums that need a default must be
  nullable with the default resolved where they are read (the `JsonNullAsDefaultAttribute` used for
  GlobalConfiguration settings records only covers the System.Text.Json path).
- Helm charts under `src/charts` follow the AB#4948 lane rule: `test/*` publishes into the shared dev
  bucket as a SemVer **prerelease**, so an unpinned `ChartVersion` keeps resolving main's newest
  stable chart.
